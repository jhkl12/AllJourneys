Users are able to see a detailed page of trail information (dificulty, length, elavation gain, route type, map, etc.) as well as leave reviews if they are signed in. Users will be able read other users reviews and create, edit or delete their own reviews.

The backend for AllJourneys is built using the Ruby on Rails framework, a PostgreSQL database and Amazon AWS S3 for image storage. The frontend for AllJourneys is built from React, with Redux to manage the frontend state. Additionally, JQuery is used to make AJAX calls to the backend.
